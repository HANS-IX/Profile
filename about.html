        <p>I used to hate reading until I got bored and decided to read the books that my big brother gave me. Not much later, 
            I discovered the joys of being immersed in worlds full of fantasy, where you can get high from your own imagination.<br><br>
            We live in a time where we are born too late to explore uncharted islands on this planet, and too early to traverse the stars within the vastness of space.
            So why not explore the wonderful creations of different people or authors and live in a world of neverending stories and adventures.
