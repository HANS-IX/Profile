          <h3 style="color: rgb(250, 93, 114)">Red Rising</h3>
  <p class="bgtexts" style="color: rgb(250, 93, 114)">A two trilogy series that's filled with gore and action in space. A great read that can get your blood pumping as adrenaline rushes inside your body. It's certainly a fun read. The first book is a bit Hunger Gamesy, but the series really picks up after that. For an action-filled book, the story does pull on your emotions.</p>

  <p class="bgtexts" style="color: rgb(40, 160, 240)">Stormlight is planned to be "10" books and it is my favourite series so far. The world Roshar and particularly the Shattered Plains is a quite unique and fascinating setting as it is filled with insect-crustaecian like creatures and beings that appear depending on current emotions. </p>

         <h3 style="color: rgb(77, 245, 91)">The Kingkiller Chronicle</h3>
<p class="bgtexts" style="color: rgb(77, 245, 91);">The Kingkiller Chronicle is a trilogy but the third one isn't out yet. In this book we get to see the rise of a legend, Kvothe.  I wouldn't call Kvothe cliche at all, given that it's all about his back story and how he got to be who he is today. It can be a bit slow at times, but all in all, I'd definitely recommend it.</p>
